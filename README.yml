         Healthcare is increasingly focusing its efforts on keeping patients 
         out of the hospital. To do so, providers must serve their patients by focusing 
         on proactive disease prevention and maintenance. Data analysis is essential 
         for understanding populations and prioritizing opportunities for intervention.

        Neural networks are increasingly being used to assist medical professional
        in their review of medical imaging studies. These models help to identify
        tumor, strokes and malignant melanomas, among other maladies.

    title: Big Data Applications in Predicting Hospital Readmissions
    abstract: >
        Hospital readmissions occur when a patient is discharged from a hospital and
	subsequently readmitted to a hospital within a short time frame. Hospitals
	are held accountable for readmissions that occur within 30 days of the initial
	inpatient stay. In 2016, nearly 2,600 hospitals were penalized $528 million
	collectively for readmissions. Machine learning is increasingly being used to
	preemptively identify patients who have a high probability of being readmitted
	within 30 days. Utilizing a dataset that includes over 100,000 patients
	admissions that occurred at 130 US hospitals between 1999 and 2008, this
	project will attempt to build algorithms that identify high risk patients.
	Open-source Python tools such as scikit-learn, pandas and matplotlib will be
	used to prepare and model data. The process and accuracy of various machine
	learning techniques will be described and compared, and the paper will discuss
	additional data elements that may allow the algorithms to make more accurate
	predictions.
