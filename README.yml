        Healthcare is increasingly focusing its efforts on keeping
        patients out of the hospital. To do so, providers must serve
        their patients by focusing on proactive disease prevention and
        maintenance. Data analysis is essential for understanding
        populations and prioritizing opportunities for intervention.

        Neural networks are increasingly being used to assist medical
        professional in their review of medical imaging studies. These
        models help to identify tumor, strokes and malignant melanomas,
        among other maladies.

    title: Big Data Applications in Predicting Hospital Readmissions
    abstract: >
        Hospital readmissions occur when a patient is discharged from a
        hospital and subsequently readmitted to a hospital within a short
        time frame. Hospitals are held accountable for readmissions that
        occur within 30 days of the initial inpatient stay. In 2016, nearly
        2,600 hospitals were penalized $528 million collectively for
        readmissions. Machine learning is increasingly being used to
        preemptively identify patients who have a high probability of being
        readmitted within 30 days. Utilizing a dataset that includes over
        100,000 patients admissions that occurred at 130 US hospitals between
        1999 and 2008, this project will attempt to build algorithms that
        identify high risk patients. Open-source Python tools such as
        scikit-learn, pandas and matplotlib will be used to prepare and model
        data. The process and accuracy of various machine learning techniques
        will be described and compared, and the paper will discuss additional
        data elements that may allow the algorithms to make more accurate
        predictions.
