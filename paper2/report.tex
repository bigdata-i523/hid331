\begin{abstract}

 Medical image analysis is proving to be a promising domain for disruption by machine learning. The analysis of medical imagery has long been within the purview of radiologists, a specialization in medicine that reviews medical imaging to form diagnoses and advise on treatment options. Historically, radiologists have relied on their training, senses and years of experience to evaluate images for medical issues, such as the presence of tumors, lung nodules, and hip osteoarthritis. The presence of technology, generally referred to as computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools, has been growing over the last several decades, but modern computing power and sizable datasets have accelerated the effectiveness of these assistive tools. Machine learning algorithms, especially artifical neural networks (ANN), are being leveraged to help identify problems present in medical images at a high level of accuracy. Several research studies conclude that ANN techniques can match, and occassionally outperform, the abilities of radiologists. Big data and the application of advanced algorithms show promise for evolving our ability to successfully evaluate medical images and save lives in the process.

\section{Introduction}

Describe the workflow of a radiologist. what is the history of the profession

what is the error rate of radiologists. burnout

machine learning - what is it. what kinds of problems can it solve

why is image recognition well suited for deep learning

how much data is there

what is deep learning, how does it compare with human brains

what is the history of neural networks, why is now the time that it's proliferating

difference between types on neural networks, which are best suited to the tast

how is this service being offered, which companies are selling, what are they doing

problems, controversies, how is it being accepted

applications of neural networks Applications â€“ hip ortho, diabetic retinopathy, mammogram, melanoma detection, lung nodules, myositis

The increased attention and effectiveness of these tools is brought on by several factors, including sufficient computing power and the availability of sufficiently large train sets needed by the ANN to understand patterns in the data \cite{editor00}.
